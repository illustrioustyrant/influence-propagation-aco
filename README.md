# Influence Propagation Based on Ant Colony Optimisation

This repository contains the source code for my undergraduate graduation thesis.

## Overview
I implemented an Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) based method to select seed sets for maximizing influence spread on social networks.

## Dataset
The experiments were conducted using datasets from the **Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP)**.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NetworkX (如果用了的话)
- Numpy/Pandas
